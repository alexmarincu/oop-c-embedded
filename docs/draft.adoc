:toc: preamble
:sectnums:

== Session 1: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
* Overview of OOP concepts
* Advantages of using OOP in embedded systems
* Introduction to the C programming language
* Encapsulation and data hiding
* Abstraction and modularity
* Inheritance and polymorphism

.Slides:
* Briefly define OOP and its benefits
* Introduce the C programming language and its relevance to embedded systems
* Explain encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism with examples
* Showcase how OOP can improve code maintainability and reusability

== Session 2: SOLID Principles
* Overview of SOLID principles
* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
* Examples and discussions related to embedded systems

.Slides:
* Present each SOLID principle with a concise definition and explanation
* Provide practical examples of how these principles can be applied in embedded systems development
* Highlight the importance of each principle in achieving code flexibility, extensibility, and testability

== Session 3: Basic Design Patterns
* Introduction to design patterns
* Creational patterns (e.g., Factory, Singleton)
* Structural patterns (e.g., Adapter, Proxy)
* Behavioral patterns (e.g., Observer, State)
* Examples of design patterns in embedded systems

.Slides:
* Introduce the concept of design patterns and their role in software development
* Discuss a selection of basic design patterns commonly used in embedded systems
* Explain the problem each pattern solves and illustrate its implementation in C

== Session 4: Clean Architecture in Embedded Systems
* Understanding clean architecture principles
* Separation of concerns
* Dependency management
* Layers and boundaries
* Applying clean architecture in an embedded systems context
* Benefits and trade-offs

.Slides:
* Define clean architecture and its guiding principles
* Describe the layers and boundaries in clean architecture
* Discuss the benefits of clean architecture in embedded systems, such as modularity and testability
* Provide code examples to demonstrate the application of clean architecture principles in C

== Session 5: Demo Project
* Overview of the demo project
* Designing the project structure using clean architecture principles
* Implementing key features using object-oriented programming in C
* Demonstrating SOLID principles and design patterns in action
* Best practices and code organization techniques

.Slides:
* Introduce the demo project and its purpose
* Showcase the project's structure based on clean architecture principles
* Walk through the implementation of key features using OOP techniques in C
* Demonstrate the application of SOLID principles and design patterns in the codebase
